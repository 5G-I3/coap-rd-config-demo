# CoRE-RD for Run-time Configuration of IoT Devices

In this demo, we showcase a user interface to configure the interaction of sensors and actuators in a constrained resource network.
We use CoRE-RD to discover those resources and determine their functionality.
This is presented as a game where the targets of player actions are configurable.
A number of IoT nodes, based on the RIOT operating system exist in the game network representing different resource types.
With Core-RD we are able to find and identify those nodes.
They can then be presented to our configuration interface to be exposed to the user in a simple drag-and-drop interface.
Our demo shows that in this way CoRE-RD can be used to enable intuitive configuration by the user.
